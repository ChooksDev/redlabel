					<h1 class="about">WHAT IS REDLABEL?</h1>
					<p>Redlabel is a new launching point for music made in Wisconsin. With the advent of the internet, Wisconsin has finally received attention in the music world, and Redlabel is our way of giving that world a place to focus. In the tradition of labels meant to give a bigger platform to an underappreciated region, we're here to document the music, not profit from it. We know artists here are creating music that's timeless but also reflective of the times, and Redlabel releases are our way of saying thank you to the artists for adding to our culture. </p>
 					<h1 class="about">WHO IS REDLABEL?</h1>
 					<p>Redlabel is a community of visual artists, musicians, and DJs. The spirit of the label comes from DJ Dev, Milwaukee-born producer and DJ who founded the label in 2014.</p>
