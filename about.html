					<h1 class="about">WHAT IS REDLABEL?</h1>
					<p>Redlabel is a new launching point for music made in Wisconsin. With the advent of the internet, Wisconsin has finally received attention in the music world, and Redlabel is our way of giving that world a place to focus. We want Redlabel to be synonymous with the best in Wisconsin music. In the tradition of labels meant to give a bigger platform to an underappreciated region, we're here to document the music, not profit from it. We know artists here are creating music that's timeless but also reflective of the times, and Redlabel releases are our way of saying thank you to the artists for adding to our culture. </p>
 					<h1 class="about">WHO IS REDLABEL?</h1>
 					<p>Redlabel is a community of visual artists, musicians, and DJs. The spirit of the label comes from DJ Dev, Milwaukee-born producer and DJ who founded the label in 2016. After working gigs as a DJ for a few years in Milwaukee and Madison, Dev met a number of incredibly talented and unique artists that were struggling to get recognition due to the lack of musical infrastructure in Wisconsin. Some of these artists have joined the Redlabel collective to work on the vision of getting a number of artists the recognition we feel they deserve by working together rather than in the typical cutthroat nature of the music business. Current members include Madison producer Bhairav, Milwaukee/Madison rapper Lex the Indigo Kid, and Milwaukee rapper and visual artist Dante Lavel. Redlabel is always expanding, and we're always looking out for new talent. If you're Wisconsin born, Wisconsin raised, or Wisconsin based, Redlabel wants to work for you.</p>
 					<h1 class="about">THE VISION</h1>
 					<p>As Redlabel grows and expands, we have a few goals for the present and future.</p>
 					<h3><strong>Become the focal point of Wisconsin music</strong></h3>
 					<p class="goal">When you think Wisconsin, we want you to think Redlabel. We want someone anywhere in the world to be able to visit this page or any of our social media pages and find out what the best Wisconsin music is all about. To achieve this, we want our artists and our brand to be everywhere we can get it. Visibility is key. Our DJs and events will focus on our artists and other Wisconsin artists, with no compromise.</p>
 					<h3>Bring out Wisconsin's full potential</h3> 
 					<p class="goal">We want our platform to encourage competition and growth. As our brand grows, we want the quality of music coming out of Wisconsin to grow as well. Our greatest challenge is proving that culture in Wisconsin can stand up to Chicago, California, New York, and any other cultural hub on the planet. We already know it can, and we won't let up until the world knows.</p>
 					<h3>Encourage Originality</h3>
 					<p class="goal">We believe that one of the best ways to maintain relevance and keep people interested in our music is to maintain an original, unique perspective that you can't get anywhere else. That's what Wisconsin's music is all about, right? We make music to experiment and express, because our shows take place in bars and basements more than stages and clubs, and record executives don't come around much. We don't think Milwaukee and Madison have a "sound", and even if they do, it's nothing like anything else. We'd like to keep it that way, no matter how much recognition we get, and we want our listeners to have experiences that are different in just the right way. We hope that this, in conjuction with our goals for visibility, paves the way for more experimental artists to be recognized for their work.</p>
 					<h3> Be Inclusive</h3>
 					<p class="goal"> Music is expression of self, inherently rooted in identity. If we limit the identities in our roster and releases, we're limiting the reach and impact that our music can have. Not only do we want artists of all identities, we want all of our artists, events, and endeavors to be accepting and respectful of any person in our space. We will take this seriously and not cut any corners or make excuses.</p>
